# IBC Watch
This tool will save a list of wallet addresses to a database, and associate them with a specific user account.

- A user can monitor a new wallet with `!moniter address`.
- A user can request the balance of their wallets with the `!balance wallet` command.
- A user can request all of their balances with the `!balances` command.

The goal is to integrate this into slack or discord, so a user can quickly see if any of their wallets are low. Here is an example of a similar tool created by Enigma
